# Hubs Foundation GitHub General Repository

This repository contains documentation for the general use of all Hubs Foundation GitHub repositories. Hubs Foundation uses GitHub repositories (60 of them, whew!), in part, for the discussion, contribution management, and feedback of the Hubs software as well as many aspects of operating an open-source non-profit webXR organization. Using GitHub in this way allows for healthy documentation of contributions, alternative viewpoints, and a detailed depth of history. We welcome the community to help us build a better organization.

Contributions to this repository are expected to be:
- of a general, overarching nature
- aligned with the Hubs Foundation Principles and Values
- professional in tone.

The documentation is under active development. If there are any changes or updates you recommend, feel free to submit a pull request or let us know in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wHmY4nd).

If you are new to GitHub, we are building training documentation to help you! Stay tuned.

This repository is maintained by the Hubs Foundation.
